/**
 * The virtual clock can be used for simulations. It can run in system mode,
 * where it just returns the same time as the system clock, or it can run in
 * virtual mode, where the clock can run at a different speed and a different
 * anchor time.
 * 
 * <p>By default the virtual clock runs in system mode (virtual time equals
 * system time, speed is 1). When you set the virtual anchor time or speed to
 * another value, the clock will run in virtual mode.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The virtual anchor time is a point where a specified virtual time is
 * anchored to the current system time at that point. If the speed is 1, this
 * just defines a time shift.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Example with speed 1:<br>
 * We may set the virtual anchor time to 10:00 when the system time is 9:30.
 * This defines a time shift of 30 minutes in advance. When the system time
 * is 10:30, the virtual time is 11:00.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Example with speed 2:<br>
 * Again we set the virtual anchor time to 10:00 when the system time is 9:30.
 * When the system time is 10:30, one hour in system time has elapsed since the
 * anchor time. Because of speed 2, that is 2 hours in virtual time, which
 * we add to the virtual anchor time. So at system time 10:30, the virtual time
 * is 12:00.</p>
