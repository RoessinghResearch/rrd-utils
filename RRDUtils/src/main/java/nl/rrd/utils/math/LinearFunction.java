/**
 * A linear function is a function that is defined by straight line segments
 * between a series of points. If there are no points, the function is defined
 * by the straight horizontal line y = 0. If there is one point, the function
 * is defined by the straight horizontal line through that point. If there are
 * two or more points, the function value of a point between the first point
 * and the last point is defined by the line segment between two points. For
 * points before the first point, the value is defined by extending the first
 * line segment (between the first and second point). For points after the last
 * point, the value is defined by extending the last line segment.
